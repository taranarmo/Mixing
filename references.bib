	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} We performed a field study on mixing and vertical heat transport under the ice cover of an Arctic lake. Mixing intensities were estimated from small-scale oscillations of water temperature and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates derived from current velocity fluctuations. Well-developed turbulent conditions prevailed in the stably stratified interfacial layer separating the ice base from the warmer deep waters. The source of turbulent mixing was identified as whole-lake (barotropic) oscillations of the water body driven by strong wind events over the ice surface. We derive a scaling of ice–water heat flux based on dissipative Kolmogorov scales and successfully tested against measured dissipation rates and under-ice temperature gradients. The results discard the conventional assumption of nearly conductive heat transport within the stratified under-ice layer and suggest contribution of the basal heat flux into the melt of ice cover is higher than commonly assumed. Decline of the seasonal ice cover in the Arctic is currently gaining recognition as a major indicator of climate change. The heat transfer at the ice–water interface remains the least studied among the mechanisms governing the growth and melting of seasonal ice. The outcomes of the study find application in the heat budget of seasonal ice on inland and coastal waters.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In this paper, the available potential energy (APE) framework of Winters et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 289, 1995, p. 115) is extended to the fully compressible Navier–Stokes equations, with the aims of clarifying (i) the nature of the energy conversions taking place in turbulent thermally stratified fluids; and (ii) the role of surface buoyancy fluxes in the Munk \& Wunsch (Deep-Sea Res., vol. 45, 1998, p. 1977) constraint on the mechanical energy sources of stirring required to maintain diapycnal mixing in the oceans. The new framework reveals that the observed turbulent rate of increase in the background gravitational potential energy GPEr, commonly thought to occur at the expense of the diffusively dissipated APE, actually occurs at the expense of internal energy, as in the laminar case. The APE dissipated by molecular diffusion, on the other hand, is found to be converted into internal energy (IE), similar to the viscously dissipated kinetic energy KE. Turbulent stirring, therefore, does not introduce a new APE/GPEr mechanical-to-mechanical energy conversion, but simply enhances the existing IE/GPEr conversion rate, in addition to enhancing the viscous dissipation and the entropy production rates. This, in turn, implies that molecular diffusion contributes to the dissipation of the available mechanical energy ME = APE + KE, along with viscous dissipation. This result has important implications for the interpretation of the concepts of mixing efficiency γmixing and flux Richardson number Rf, for which new physically based definitions are proposed and contrasted with previous definitions.The new framework allows for a more rigorous and general re-derivation from the first principles of Munk \& Wunsch (1998, hereafter MW98)'s constraint, also valid for a non-Boussinesq ocean:

where G(KE) is the work rate done by the mechanical forcing, Wr, forcing is the rate of loss of GPEr due to high-latitude cooling and ξ is a nonlinearity parameter such that ξ = 1 for a linear equation of state (as considered by MW98), but ξ {\textless} 1 otherwise. The most important result is that G(APE), the work rate done by the surface buoyancy fluxes, must be numerically as large as Wr, forcing and, therefore, as important as the mechanical forcing in stirring and driving the oceans. As a consequence, the overall mixing efficiency of the oceans is likely to be larger than the value γmixing = 0.2 presently used, thereby possibly eliminating the apparent shortfall in mechanical stirring energy that results from using γmixing = 0.2 in the above formula.},

	abstract = {Nonstationary convection forced by distributed buoyancy sources is a fundamental environmental fluid mechanics process, particularly in ice-covered freshwater waterbodies. In this paper, we present novel field-based results that characterise the diurnal evolution of the main energetics of radiatively-driven convection in ice-covered lakes that is the radiatively-induced buoyancy flux, B, and the kinetic energy dissipation rate, εε{\textbackslash}varepsilon. To estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of εε{\textbackslash}varepsilon, we applied scale similarity of the velocity structure functions to identify the fine turbulence scales from high-frequency velocity measurements. The field study was carried out at Lake Vendyurskoe, Russia, in April 2016. Small-scale velocity fluctuations were measured using acoustic Doppler current profiler in a 2 m layer beneath the ice cover. The method was proven to be valid for low-energy convection without mean shear. The inertial subrange, covering order of magnitude in the spatial domain, was identified by fitting the 2/32/3{\textasciicircum}2/\_3 scaling power law to the structure function method, thus confirming the regime of fully developed turbulence. The calculated rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy εε{\textbackslash}varepsilon reaches values up to 3×10−9 m2s−33×10−9 m2s−33 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-9\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{ m\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textbackslash}hbox \{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}. Although a strong correlation between εε{\textbackslash}varepsilon and B was observed, εε{\textbackslash}varepsilon picks up about 1 h later after the onset of the heating-phase. This delay roughly corresponds to the turnover time of the energy containing eddies. We finally observed a decay of εε{\textbackslash}varepsilon at night, during the relaxation-phase, but, interestingly, the level remained above the statistical error.},

	abstract = {The vertical diffusivity of density, Kρ, regulates ocean circulation, climate and coastal water quality. Kρ is difficult to measure and model in these stratified turbulent flows, resulting in the need for the development of Kρ parameterizations from more readily measurable flow quantities. Typically, Kρ is parameterized from turbulent temperature fluctuations using the Osborn–Cox model or from the buoyancy frequency, N, kinematic viscosity, ν, and the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy, ε, using the Osborn model. More recently, Shih et al. (2005, J. Fluid Mech. 525: 193–214) proposed a laboratory scale parameterization for Kρ, at Prandtl number (ratio of the viscosity over the molecular diffusivity) Pr=0.7, in terms of the turbulence intensity parameter, Reb=ϵ/(νN2), which is the ratio between the destabilizing effect of turbulence to the stabilizing effects of stratification and viscosity. In the present study, we extend the SKIF parameterization, against extensive sets of published data, over 0.7{\textless}Pr{\textless}700 and validate it at field scale. Our results show that the SKIF model must be modified to include a new Buoyancy-controlled mixing regime, between the Molecular and Transitional regimes, where Kρ is captured using the molecular diffusivity and Osborn model, respectively. The Buoyancy-controlled regime occurs over 102/3Pr−1/2{\textless}Reb{\textless}(3   lnPr)2, where Kρ=0.1/Pr1/4ν   Reb3/2 is Pr dependent. This range is shown to be characteristic to lakes and oceans and both the Osborn and Osborn–Cox models systematically underestimate Kρ in this regime.},

Измерения проводились в апреле 2008 г. на 18 склоновых станциях с глубинами от 2.5 до 9.3 м с преобладанием жидких илистых отложений. Установлено, что вблизи границы с илами содержание растворенного кислорода резко уменьшается, при этом максимальный его градиент достигает 9 (мгО2/л)/см непосредственно на границе воды и ила. Показано, что скорость потребления кислорода донными отложениями на станциях с глубинами 6–8 м максимальна и в 1.5 раза выше, чем на станциях с меньшими и большими глубинами. С учетом батиметрической кривой озера, оценен объем поглощения растворенного кислорода всей площадью донных отложений. Сопоставление полученных оценок с данными измерений содержания растворенного кислорода в водной толще озера в этот же период позволяет утверждать, что более 60\% его уменьшения на этапе зимней стагнации приходится на поглощение илами, и менее 40\% на деструкцию лабильного органического вещества в водной толще.},

Совместный анализ метео информации и данных полевых измерений температуры и содержания растворенного кислорода в небольшом мелководном озере Вендюрском позволил изучить влияние погодных условий «нетипичной» весны 2016 г., когда озеро вышло из-подо льда устойчиво стратифицированным, на особенности формирования теплового и газового режимов его водной толщи и придонных слоев в летний период. Показано, что в результате весенней меромиксии стратификация в озере сохранялась более месяца. Оценка атмосферного воздействия на озеро с привлечением модифицированного масштаба длины Монина-Обухова позволила определить предельные значения скоростей ветра и величины кинематического потока тепла на поверхности, необходимые для полного перемешивания его водной толщи. Серия численных экспериментов на одномерной параметрической модели Flake позволила установить, что при определенных погодных условиях (теплая весна, длительная подледная конвекция, жаркая маловетреная погода после взлома льда) озеро теряет период весеннего перемешивания, выходя из-подо льда уже устойчиво стратифицированным. Результаты расчетов на модели показали, что отсутствие полного весеннего перемешивания после взлома льда может негативно сказаться на газовом режиме озера в летний период, поскольку при этом не происходит разрушения «зимней» придонной анаэробной зоны и при теплой маловетреной погоде летних месяцев продолжительность непрерывного существования придонной аноксии может превышать 7-8 месяцев.},

To investigate the processes driving the hypoxia, we conducted a 2-yr field campaign where the mixing in the lake interior during the stratification period was examined using current meters and temperature-loggers data, as well as {\textgreater} 600 temperature microstructure profiles, from which turbulent mixing was computed. Near-inertial Poincaré waves drive shear instability, generating ? 1-m amplitude and 10-m wavelength high-frequency internal waves with ? 1-mdensity overturns that lead to an increase in turbulent dissipation by one order of magnitude. The instabilities are associated with enhanced vertical shear at the crests and troughs of the Poincaré waves and may be correlated with the local gradient Richardson number. Poincaré wave?induced mixing should be an important factor when the Burger number {\textless} 0.25. The strong diapycnal mixing induced by the Poincaré wave activity will also significantly modify the energy-flux paths. For example, we estimate that, in Lake Erie, 0.85\% of the wind energy is transferred to the lake interior (below the surface layer); of this, 40\% is dissipated in the interior metalimnion and 60\% is dissipated at the bottom boundary. In smaller lakes, 0.42\% of wind energy is transferred to the deeper water, with 90\% dissipated in the boundary and 10\% in the interior metalimnion.},

It is suggested that principal sources of such energy can be found in decaying convective clouds and thunderstorm anvil outflows. These are believed to evolve similarly to the wake of a moving body in a stably stratified flow. Following the scale analysis by Riley, Metcalfe and Weissman it is expected that, in the presence of strong stratification, initially three-dimensionally isotropic turbulence divides roughly equally into gravity waves and stratified (quasi-two- dimensional) turbulence. The former then propagates away from the generation region, while the latter propagates in spectral space to larger scales, forming the −5/3 upscale transfer spectrum predicted by Kraichnan. Part of the energy of the stratified turbulence is recycled into three-dimensional turbulence by shearing instability, but the upscale escape of only a few percent of the total energy released by small-scale turbulence is apparently sufficient to explain the observed mesoscale energy spectrum of the troposphere. A close analogy is found between the turbulence-gravity wave exchanges considered here and the turbulence-β-wave exchanges discussed by Rhines and Williams.},

Winds varied from near calm to 5 m s?1 but reached 10 m s?1 during three storm events. Near-surface values of ε were typically on the order of 10?8 to 10?7 m2 s?3 and reached 10?5 m2 s?3 during windy periods. Above a depth equal to {\textbar}LMO{\textbar}, the Monin-Obukhov length scale, turbulence was dominated by wind shear and dissipation followed neutral law of the wall scaling augmented by buoyancy flux during cooling. During cooling, εz?=?0.56 /kz?+?0.77 JB0 and during heating εz?=?0.6 /kz, where is the water friction velocity computed from wind shear stress, k is von Karman's constant, z is depth, and JB0 is surface buoyancy flux. Below a depth equal to {\textbar}LMO{\textbar} during cooling, dissipation was uniform with depth and controlled by buoyancy flux. Departures from similarity scaling enabled identification of additional processes that moderate near-surface turbulence including mixed layer deepening at the onset of cooling, high-frequency internal waves when the diurnal thermocline was adjacent to the air-water interface, and horizontal advection caused by differential cooling. The similarity scaling enables prediction of near-surface ε as required for estimating the gas transfer coefficient using the surface renewal model and for understanding controls on scalar transport.},

	abstract = {In winter, the reflective properties of ice-and-snow-covered lakes and the surrounding surface covered with snow differ little. Estimation of the albedo becomes especially important in spring when the reflectivity of the ice-covered lakes differs markedly from the surrounding snow-free surface. The measurements of the snow and ice albedo in situ are necessary to ensure adequate analysis of remote sensing data and monitoring of the state of the land ice. A wide range of surface albedo of small boreal ice-covered Lake Vendyurskoe (North-Western Russia) is calculated from observational data of solar radiation obtained in 1995\&ndash;2000 and 2002\&ndash;2017. A noticeable variability of albedo due to spring melting and changes in weather conditions is described. Climatic variability (North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, the average monthly air temperature and sum of precipitation in December-March) is analyzed in the context of possible influence on the maximal thickness of snow and white ice, and, consequently, on the spring lake albedo dynamics. In current work to estimate the external heat flux that comes from the atmosphere to the surface of the lake and presumably determines the dynamics of albedo during spring melting, a simple parameter was used: the accumulated sum of positive temperatures, starting from March 1. The obtained prognostic equation of the cubic dependence of albedo on the named parameter demonstrates a different rate of albedo decrease in the melting of snow, white, and congelation ice.},

	abstract = {Lorenz's theory of available potential energy (APE) remains the main framework for studying the atmospheric and oceanic energy cycles. Because the APE generation rate is the volume integral of a thermodynamic efficiency times the local diabatic heating/cooling rate, APE theory is often regarded as an extension of the theory of heat engines. Available energetics in classical thermodynamics, however, usually relies on the concept of exergy and is usually measured relative to a reference-state maximizing entropy at constant energy, whereas APE's reference state minimizes potential energy at constant entropy. This review seeks to shed light on the two concepts; it covers local formulations of available energetics, alternative views of the dynamics/thermodynamics coupling, APE theory and the second law of thermodynamics, APE production/dissipation, extensions to binary fluids, mean/eddy decompositions, APE in incompressible fluids, APE and irreversible turbulent mixing, and the role of mechanical forcing on APE production.},

The concept of gravitational available potential energy is used to formulate an energy budget in which the evolution of the background potential energy, i.e. the minimum potential energy attainable through adiabatic motions, can be explicitly examined. For closed systems, the background potential energy can change only due to diabatic processes. The rate of change of background potential energy is proportional to the molecular diffusivity. Changes in the background potential energy provide a direct measure of the potential energy changes due to irreversible diapycnal mixing. For open systems, background potential energy can also change due to boundary fluxes, which can be explicitly measured. The analysis is particularly appropriate for evaluation of diabatic mixing rates in numerical simulations of turbulent flows. The energetics of a shear driven mixing layer is used to illustrate the analysis.},

Horizontal and vertical measurements of temperature and electrical conductivity measurements were collected using a conductivity-temperature-depth logger mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle and additional instrumentation. These measurements revealed a cylindrical density anomaly with a radius of ?110 m extending from the surface to ?14 m depth. The observed radius is smaller than the internal Rossby radius of deformation (? 200 m), which suggests a cyclogeostrophic balance between centripetal, Coriolis, and pressure forces. The maximum azimuthal velocity, calculated assuming this balance, was ? 2.1 cm s?1 at 6?8 m depth. The Rossby number associated with this velocity was 1.7; this is consistent with the cyclogeostrophic assumption (i.e., Rossby number {\textgreater} 1) and nearly twice that of similar under-ice eddies in the Arctic Ocean. The estimated Ekman spin-down timescale is 1.5?15 d, but despite this, the gyre appeared to be relatively unchanged over 6 d of field observations. This persistence implies the gyre was forced over the course of the field study; however, the source of the forcing is unknown. Horizontal temperature transects at and below the bottom of the gyre revealed coherent temperature fluctuations suggestive of vertical transport associated with the gyre.},

The five-beam configuration allows for a direct estimation of the Reynolds stresses from along-beam velocity fluctuations. The Nortek’s low Doppler noise and high sampling frequency allow for the observation of the turbulent inertial subrange in both the frequency spectra and the turbulence structure function. The turbulence parameters obtained from the five-beam acoustic Doppler current profilers are validated with turbulence data from simultaneous measurements with acoustic Doppler velocimeters. These combined results are then used to assess a turbulent kinetic energy budget in which depth profiles of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and production rates are compared.

He points out that in such situations kinetic energy of turbulence is converted, over a wide range of scales, to potential energy of the resulting density deviations, that this potential energy is subsequently destroyed by the action of further turbulent mixing and molecular diffusion, and, finally, that the primary effect is to reduce the viscous dissipation rate significantly below that which normally would be estimated on the basis of large-scale turbulent motions. Universal forms are predicted for the kinetic energy and density fluctuation spectra, and in the buoyancy subrange (the part of the equilibrium range that reflects the anisotropy induced by the density gradient) the energy spectrum is found to be proportional to k−11/5, the density spectrum to k−7/5.},

	abstract = {Owing to turbulence the instantaneous distribution of wind velocity, temperature, humidity and other meteorological elements is of a very complicated character, the elements at different points undergoing random and often very considerable fluctuations. Similarly, the values of the same elements at a fixed point and at different moments are characterized by random fluctuations having a very wide spectrum. Space and time fluctuations of meteorological elements are of general geophysical interest since they characterize atmospheric turbulence which is one of the most important features of atmospheric motion. Moreover, the study of fluctuations has an applied significance as one needs to know the statistical characteristics of fluctuations for the determination of the rate of the turbulent exchange in the surface layer, for the theory of meteorological instruments and for a number of problems of atmospheric optics, atmospheric acoustics and radio-meteorology. Because of their wide spectrum (both in space and time) the methods of study of these fluctuations vary according to the particular part of the spectrum which we are interested in. Here we shall mainly deal with the problem of small-scale turbulence (of the micro-inhomogeneities of the atmospheric fields) which are characterized by periods of a few hundredths of a second to some seconds and space scales of a few centimetres to some metres. Our considerations will mostly refer to the surface layer which has been most studied. In the U.S.S.R. a number of theoretical and experimental investigations concerning the microstructure of the principle meteorological fields, mainly those of the wind velocity and temperature, have recently been carried out. The results of these investigations are in satisfactory agreement. Simultaneously some special problems of the physics of the atmosphere using the above-mentioned results have been treated. A brief review of all the investigations is given below.},

	volume = {781},
	doi = {10.1017/jfm.2015.462},
	abstract = {The concept of a mixing efficiency is widely used to relate the amount of irreversible diabatic mixing in a stratified flow to the amount of energy available to support mixing. This common measure of mixing in a flow is based on the change in the background potential energy, which is the minimum gravitational potential energy of the fluid that can be achieved by an adiabatic rearrangement of the instantaneous density field. However, this paper highlights examples of mixing that is primarily ‘buoyancy-driven’ (i.e. energy is released to the flow predominantly from a source of available potential energy) to demonstrate that the mixing efficiency depends not only on the specific characteristics of the turbulence in the region of the flow that is mixing, but also on the density profile in regions remote from where mixing physically occurs. We show that this behaviour is due to the irreversible and direct conversion of available potential energy into background potential energy in those remote regions (a mechanism not previously described). This process (here termed ‘relabelling’) occurs without requiring either a local flow or local mixing, or any other process that affects the internal energy of that fluid. Relabelling is caused by initially available potential energy, associated with identifiable parcels of fluid, becoming dynamically inaccessible to the flow due to mixing elsewhere. These results have wider relevance to characterising mixing in stratified turbulent flows, including those involving an external supply of kinetic energy.},

	abstract = {Well-resolved numerical simulations of turbulent open channel flows are analyzed to evaluate the accuracy of the 2nd order structure function method (SFM) in estimating the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy within boundary layers. The objective is to assess the variation in the 2/3 Kolmogorov constants due to flow anisotropy with distance from the wall. Comparison of the dissipation calculated directly from the numerical data, with that from the SFM shows that usage of the canonical constants, based on the assumption of local isotropy, can result in considerable error ({\textgreater}50\%) in the prediction of dissipation when using the vertical or spanwise velocity components. From the numerically calculated dissipation, optimal Kolmogorov 2/3 constants were obtained and empirical relations, which account for near-wall effects, were proposed. Usage of the optimal constants will improve estimation of the dissipation rate when the SFM is applied to compute dissipation in geophysical boundary-layer flows.},

	abstract = {When some external agency imposes on a fluid large-scale variations of some dynamically passive, conserved, scalar quantity θ like temperature or concentration of solute, turbulent motion of the fluid generates small-scale variations of θ. This paper describes a theoretical investigation of the form of the spectrum of θ at large wave-numbers, taking into account the two effects of convection with the fluid and molecular diffusion with diffusivity k. Hypotheses of the kind made by Kolmogoroff for the small-scale variations of velocity in a turbulent motion at high Reynolds number are assumed to apply also to small-scale variations of θ.Previous contributions to the problem are reviewed. These have established that the spectrum of θ varies as n−53n−53 n{\textasciicircum}\{- {\textbackslash}frac \{5\} \{3\}\} (n being wave-number) at the low wave-number end of the equilibrium range, but there has been some confusion about the wave-number marking the upper end of the range of validity of this relation. The existence of a conduction ‘cut-off’ near n={\textbackslash}isin{\textbackslash}solk3)14n={\textbackslash}isin{\textbackslash}solk3)14 n = {\textbackslash}isin\{{\textbackslash}sol\}k \{{\textasciicircum}3\}) \{{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}frac \{1\} \{4\}\} as put forward by Obukhoff and Corrsin is shown to hold only when ν [Lt ] κ, and that near n = (ε/νκ2) 1414 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\} \{4\}\} put forward by Batchelor is shown to apply only when ν [Gt ] κ. In the case ν [Lt ] κ, the remaining problem is to determine the form of the spectrum of θ beyond the conduction cut-off; this is done in Part 2. In the case ν [Gt ] κ, the conduction cut-off occurs at wave-numbers much higher than (ε/ν3)1414 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\} \{4\}\}, which is where the energy spectrum is cut off by viscosity, and where the spectrum of θ ceases to vary as n−53n−53 n{\textasciicircum}\{- {\textbackslash}frac \{5\} \{3\}\}.The form of the spectrum of θ in this latter case is determined over the range n {\textgreater} (ε/ν3)1414 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\} \{4\}\} by analysing the effect of the velocity field, regarded as effectively a persistent uniform straining motion for these small-scale variations of θ, and of molecular diffusion on a single Fourier component of θ. The wave-number of this sinusoidal variation of θ is changed (and generally increased in magnitude) by the straining motion and the amplitude is diminished by diffusion. By supposing that the level of the spectrum of θ is kept steady at wave-numbers near (ε/ν3)1414 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\} \{4\}\} by some mechanism of transfer from lower wave-numbers, the linearity of the equation for θ then allows the determination of the spectrum for n {\textgreater} (ε/ν3) 1414 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac \{1\} \{4\}\}, the result being given by (4.8). The same result is obtained, using essentially the same approximation about the velocity field, from a different kind of analysis in terms of velocity and θ correlations. Finally, the relation between this work and Townsend's model of the small-scale variations of vorticity in a turbulent fluid is discussed.},

These waves are called internal tides and their dissipation due to nonlinear wave breaking and concomitant three-dimensional turbulence could play an important role in the mixing of the abyssal ocean, and hence in controlling the large-scale ocean circulation.As part of on-going work aimed at providing a theory for the vertical distribution of wave breaking over sea-floor topography, in this paper we investigate the instability of internal tides in a very simple linear model that helps us to relate the formation of unstable regions to simple features in the sea-floor topography. For two-dimensional tides over one-dimensional topography we find that the formation of overturning instabilities is closely linked to the singularities in the topography shape and that it is possible to have stable waves at the sea floor and unstable waves in the ocean interior above.For three-dimensional tides over two-dimensional topography there is in addition an effect of geometric focusing of wave energy into localized regions of high wave amplitude, and we investigate this focusing effect in simple examples. Overall, we find that the distribution of unstable wave breaking regions can be highly non-uniform even for very simple idealized topography shapes.},

	abstract = {A small range (∼ 1°C) of under-ice water temperature is shown to result in remarkably different circulation regimes under spring ice in a deep, oligotrophic boreal lake. With the water column at {\textless} 4°C, melting of snow led to deepening vertical convection before ice break and a final depth of convection inversely correlated with earlier deep-water temperature. We attribute that to the nonlinear dependence of water density on temperature, albeit further affected by stochastic weather factors. In four of nine study years, convection led to complete under-ice overturn of the lake, indicating that this may not be uncommon in similar lakes with steep topography. River inflow and more intensive warming of water in the littoral zone also created a horizontal density differential, convection that involved flow down the sloping bottom and a lateral intrusion of this sinking water at a depth between the vertical convection and the quiescent deep-water layers. The vertical and horizontal convection together produced a profile of temperature slightly increasing from the surface to the bottom of the convection layer. The contribution of horizontal convection to under-ice mixing was interannually variable, and in one of the study years it eventually dominated under-ice mixing. A thermal bar circulation regime developed occasionally and only in the open water between ice and shoreline. We identified five different under-ice mixing regimes that form an interannually variable continuum of behavior during the ice melting period. The dependence on a narrow temperature range likely makes the circulation regime sensitive to a warming climate.},

	abstract = {Mixing in the abyssal ocean is known to play an important role in controlling the large-scale ocean circulation. In the search for sources of mechanical energy for mixing, internal tides generated by the interaction of the barotropic tide with bottom topography (mode conversion) have been implicated. However, estimates of the rate at which barotropic tidal energy is converted into the internal wave field are quite uncertain. Here, I present analytical and numerical calculations of internal tide generation in a fluid layer of finite depth to better understand the energetics of the wave generation process. Previous theoretical models of wave generation have assumed an upper radiation boundary condition (BC) appropriate for an ocean of infinite depth. But recent observations of internal tides at significant distances from their generation region indicate that this BC is not always valid, and that reflection from the upper surface is important. I show that the presence of an upper free-surface reduces the rate at which energy is fed into the internal wave field (the power) and thus the energy available for mixing. This reduction increases with the horizontal extent of the topography (relative to the wavelength of a mode-1 internal wave). Fully nonhydrostatic, nonlinear numerical calculations are used to both test the theory and to explore more realistic parameters for which linear theories are formally invalid. As bottom topography becomes steeper, linear theory underestimates mode conversion by an increasing amount, although even at critical slope the difference is quite small (O(20\%)). An important finding of this study is that for certain topographic shapes the power input into the wave field can saturate as the topography becomes supercritical. A comparison of model results with a recent finite amplitude theory suggests that even though finite depth effects may be negligible in the linear regime, they may become important when the topography is of finite amplitude. The results of process studies such as this should lead to improved estimates of mode conversion in the ocean.},

Physical properties of both ice cover and ice-covered water column are considered. For the former, growth and decay of the seasonal ice, its structure, mechanical and optical properties are discussed. The latter subject deals with circulation and mixing under ice. The relative contribution of the two major circulation drivers, namely heat release from sediment and solar heating, is used for classifying the typical circulation and mixing patterns under ice. In order to provide a physical basis for lake ice phenology, the heat transfer processes related to formation and melting of the seasonal ice cover are discussed in a separate section.

Recent theoretical developments for parts of this parameter space particularly relevant to the deep ocean show that most of the energy flux is associated with low modes that propagate away from the generation region. For isolated features this energy flux is not strongly dependent on the bottom slope. Intense beams of internal tidal energy are expected near “critical slopes," bottom slopes equal to the ray slope, and lead to local mixing.},

The formalism is restricted here to essentially two-dimensional topography whose surface is never tangential to the local direction of internal tidal energy propagation, but has otherwise arbitrary shape. The theory is applicable to a wide range of density stratifications which permits a two-parameter fit to any oceanic case. Results have been calculated for certain representative topographic shapes, most notably continental slopes, and these indicate that the rate of conversion of surface tide energy into internal tide energy generally increases rapidly with topographic height, but also depends strongly on the geometry. For instance, for this model, continental slopes are far more effective internal tide generators than, say, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. For a model ocean with constant Brunt-Väisälä frequency, N, the internal wave energy fluxes on each side of a continental slope (satisfying the above criteria) are approximately equal, but for an ocean with a realistic density profile the energy flux and energy density are larger on the shallow continental shelf than in the deep ocean.},

	abstract = {Analytical estimates of the rate at which energy is extracted from the barotropic tide at topography and converted into internal gravity waves are given. The ocean is idealized as an inviscid, vertically unbounded fluid on the f plane. The gravity waves are treated by linear theory and freely escape to z = ∞. Several topographies are investigated: a sinusoidal ripple, a set of Gaussian bumps, and an ensemble of “random topographies.” In the third case, topographic profiles are generated by randomly selecting the amplitudes of a Fourier superposition so that the power spectral density is similar to that of submarine topography. The authors' focus is the dependence of the conversion rate (watts per square meter of radiated power) on the amplitude of the topography, h0, and on a nondimensional parameter ϵ∗, defined as the ratio of the slope of an internal tidal ray to the maximum slope of the topography. If ϵ∗ ≪ 1, then Bell's theory indicates that the conversion is proportional to . The results span the interval 0 ≤ ϵ∗ {\textless} 1 and show that the enhancement above Bell's prediction is a smoothly and modestly increasing function of ϵ∗: For ϵ∗ → 1, the conversion of sinusoidal topography is 56\% greater than Bell's ϵ∗ ≪ 1 estimate, while the enhancement is only 14\% greater for a Gaussian bump. With random topography, the enhancement at ϵ∗ = 0.95 is typically about 6\% greater than Bell's formula. The ϵ∗ ≪ 1 approximation is therefore quantitatively accurate over the range 0 {\textless} ϵ∗ {\textless} 1, implying that the conversion is roughly proportional to . As ϵ∗ is increased, the radiated waves develop very small spatial scales that are not present in the underlying topography and, when ϵ∗ approaches unity, the associated spatial gradients become so steep that overturns must occur even if the tidal amplitude is very weak. The solutions formally become singular at ϵ∗ = 1, in a breakdown of linear, inviscid theory.},

	abstract = {The generation of internal waves by the interaction of deep ocean flows with bottom topography is considered. The interaction of quasi-steady currents with the bottom topography is found to produce an internal wave drag and associated momentum flux of roughly ½ dyn/cm2, which is comparable to the average wind stress on the ocean surface. The waves are probably dissipated by critical layer phenomena in the lowest kilometer or so of the ocean, the result being a wave-induced vertical mixing coefficient of order 10 cm2/s in that portion of the water column. The interaction of the barotropic tide with the bottom topography is found to result in a flux of energy of order 1 erg/cm2 s into the internal tide, which may represent a nonnegligible sink of the tidal energy. This mechanism appears to be capable of supplying a significant portion of the observed internal wave energy in the ocean. The internal tide is probably dissipated by inherently nonlinear phenomena: spectral transport by weak interactions and, in the upper oceans, strong interactions manifested by localized instabilities resulting in isolated patches of turbulence.},

Attention is primarily directed to the behaviour of the solution in various limiting cases, and to estimating the flux of energy into the internal wave field. In general, waves are generated not only at the fundamental frequency ω0, but also at all of its harmonics. But, for values of ω0/N greater than about one half, the waves of fundamental frequency are dominant. For values of ω0/N, less than about one half, the quasi-static approximation, in which the problem is considered as a slowly-varying version of the classical lee wave problem, is found to provide a viable estimate for the wave field. The general solution is found to compare favourably with the limited available experimental data.},

Temperature gradients were measured just below the ice cover and in the upper 10-cm layer of the bottom sediments. The isotherms were found to be almost horizontal and evenly spaced vertically, so no conditions for large-scale, density-induced currents existed. The heat flux from sediments to water ranged from 0.6 to 2.0 W m−2. These values were inversely related to the depth. The heat flux from water to ice ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 W m−2. When water heating from solar radiation penetration became apparent, this flux increased by a factor of two. When solar radiation increased, convection occurred in the upper layers of the water column. When solar radiation heating became significant at the beginning of spring, the average net heat flux at the ice-water interface during daytime was 7.7 W m−2. Weak currents (few mm s−1) with a seiche-like character were observed, which most likely resulted from ice-cover oscillations.},

	abstract = {An objective measure of the length scale of turbulent overturning events, the Thorpe scale, LT, is compared to the Ozmidov scale L0 = (ε/N3)1/2, where N is the buoyancy frequency and ε is the kinetic energy dissipation rate. Far from the surface in wind-forced mixing layers and in the seasonal thermocline, L0 and LT are of the same order, but near the surface of a mixing layer, L0 is significantly larger than LT. The change in the ratio L0/LT is attributed to a decrease in the gradient Richardson number in the highly energetic zone near the surface. Another length scale, LB = (DCx/N)1/2, where Cx is the Cox number and D is the molecular diffusivity of temperature, is the same order as LT near the surface of a mixing layer as well as in the layer interior and in the seasonal thermocline. It is shown, by using the turbulent kinetic energy budget, that LB/LT is only weakly dependent on the gradient Richardson number as long as the ratio of eddy viscosity to eddy diffusivity is constant. The temperature variance dissipation rate is compared to the product of the buoyancy frequency and the existing temperature variance. Temperature fluctuations are defined as the temperature difference between the observed temperature profile and the Thorpe profile (the temperature profile which would result if an overturning patch gravitationally collapsed without dissipation). It is shown that the major balance in the temperature variance equation is between the rate at which variance is produced and the rate at which it is dissipated and that the rate of change of temperature variance can be an important modification to this balance only if the variance decays in a time much smaller than a buoyancy period.},

Following an initial instability, the vertical shear is spread into a layer growing at just the rate required to maintain the layer Richardson number at a critical value. For instabilities in the gross density profile, the layer thickness is determined by the vertical scale of the shear maximum; fine-structure concentrates the instability along thin sheets and leads to more frequent breaking, but of smaller vertical extent (the scale now being determined by the fine-structure). The resultant buoyancy flux can be interpreted in terms of an eddy diffusivity, but the numerical evaluation is extremely uncertain. Properties of the internal wave field will cause the horizontal scale of the mixed layer so formed to exceed by several orders the vertical scale and similarly the horizontal diffusivity to exceed the vertical diffusivity.

Here we present results from Mono Lake, California, that illustrate pronounced steepening of the pycnocline upon cessation of strong wind forcing and the enhanced turbulence resulting from this nonlinearity. Three events occurred with wind speed of {\textgreater}10 m s−1. Upwind, the upper pycnocline upwelled, but on relaxation of the wind, it downwelled 6–10 m and compressed. The similarity of wave amplitude during compression to mixed layer depth and Lake numbers {\textless}4 were indicative of significant nonlinearity. Energy in the internal wave field increased by two orders of magnitude, but 50\% of the energy was lost within 24 h. The largest energy losses occurred at low frequencies rather than via an energy flux from low to moderate and high frequencies. Eddy diffusivities, computed over 6-d intervals using the heat budget method, averaged 10−6 m2 s−1 in the energized pycnocline but were five to 10 times higher during the initial upwelling and downwelling periods. Microstructure casts, taken 1-2 d after the first event, revealed that the percentage of the pycnocline that was turbulent varied with bottom slope, being 80\% turbulent where bottom slopes were up to 10\%, 60\% where bottom slopes were 3\%, and less than 7\% where bottom slopes were 0.1\%. The threshold for turbulent transport was exceeded only 10\% of the time and only where bottom slopes were highest.},

The part of the water column which was mixing tended to be subdivided into two regions with different dynamics, one in which the turbulence was active and one in which it was constrained by buoyancy. Generally the upper layer, which ranged from 0.3 to 1.5 m deep, was actively mixing. Energy dissipation rates were on the order of 10−7 m2 s−3, vertical eddy diffusivities ranged from 10−3 to 10−5 m2 s−1, and overturns mixed on a time scale of minutes. Phytoplankton could become well mixed before turbulent transport within overturns ceased and, while the wind persisted, were likely to experience continuous fluctuations in irradiance. In one of the largest overturns, phytoplankton could circulate between the 90\% light level and the 5\% light level in 3–4 min. Where buoyancy affected turbulence, energy dissipation rates ranged from 10−9 to 10−7 m2 s−3 and vertical eddy diffusivities from 10−7 to 10−4 m2 s−1. Mixing times based on these diffusivities exceeded π/N, the time scale for turbulent transport, indicating overturns would mix only partially.

	abstract = {Temperature-gradient microstructure and nutrient profiling were undertaken at both an inshore and an offshore site on Mono Lake, California, to determine whether boundary mixing occurred and the effects on nutrient flux within the lake. Turbulence, as quantified by rates of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy, was two to three orders of magnitude higher at the inshore site where the pycnocline intersected the bottom than at the same depths at an offshore station. The intense turbulence primarily occurred within 3.5 m of the sediment–water interface. In addition, temperature profiles were more incrementally stepped in the pycnocline inshore than offshore. The Turner angle indicated that double-diffusive processes may have augmented turbulent transport in the upper 10 m, where temperatures were inversely stratified, but not in the main pycnocline. Within the pycnocline, ϵ exceeded the threshold value for buoyancy flux ( ϵthr = 15υN2) in 21\% of the turbulent layers inshore but in only 1\% of the layers offshore. The coefficient of vertical eddy diffusivity, Κz, was two to four orders of magnitude higher within 4 m of the bottom inshore than offshore at the same depths. Spatially averaged values of Κz, obtained from the heat-flux method using data obtained from both conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) profiles and moored thermistor chains, were two orders of magnitude less than those obtained nearshore with microstructure profiling. From the differences in Κz, we inferred that most heat flux occurred due to boundary mixing at the base of the pycnocline inshore with the heat redistributed laterally by advection. Boundary mixing was initiated after winds were strong enough for the Lake number to decrease to a value of 2; thermocline compression and steepening of internal waves at the base of the pycnocline occurred, followed by packets of high-frequency internal waves critical for wave breaking. Calculated ammonium fluxes at the inshore site were sufficient to support daily rates of primary productivity in the deep chlorophyll maximum throughout the lake. These results indicate the vertical flux of nutrients across the nutricline in Mono Lake occurs over a limited area during intense mixing events initiated by high winds.},

The oscillation period, obtained from spectral density calculations, corresponded to that of a barotropic uninodal seiche. The seichelike nature of the current oscillations was supported by the results from analysis of icelevel fluctuations, giving identical periods and a phase shift of one-fourth the period between the two types of oscillations. Mean currents measured during the winter were on the order of millimeters per second. Because Lake Vendyurskoe does not have any significant river inflow or outflow during winter, the most probable cause of these currents is horizontal temperature (pressure) gradients. Scaling analysis indicated that these currents are geostrophic. This was supported by theoretical estimates, based on observed horizontal temperature gradients, being of the same order as the observed currents.

	abstract = {The spatial distribution of turbulent dissipation rates and internal wavefield characteristics is analyzed across two contrasting regimes of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), using microstructure and finestructure data collected as part of the Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean (DIMES). Mid-depth turbulent dissipation rates are found to increase from in the Southeast Pacific to in the Scotia Sea, typically reaching within a kilometer of the seabed. Enhanced levels of turbulent mixing are associated with strong near-bottom flows, rough topography, and regions where the internal wavefield is found to have enhanced energy, a less-inertial frequency content and a dominance of upward propagating energy. These results strongly suggest that bottom-generated internal waves play a major role in determining the spatial distribution of turbulent dissipation in the ACC. The energy flux associated with the bottom internal wave generation process is calculated using wave radiation theory, and found to vary between 0.8 mW m−2 in the Southeast Pacific and 14 mW m−2 in the Scotia Sea. Typically, 10\%–30\% of this energy is found to dissipate within 1 km of the seabed. Comparison between turbulent dissipation rates inferred from finestructure parameterizations and microstructure-derived estimates suggests a significant departure from wave-wave interaction physics in the near-field of wave generation sites.},

Experiments are used to show that oscillatory motions of ice can serve a source of energy for the development of water mass movement in ice-covered lakes. Wind is shown to be the most likely factor generating oscillatory motions of water in ice-covered lakes.

Tracking of a tracer injected into the metalimnion was combined with measurements of meteorological forcing, internal waves, and temperature microstructure. Seiches of vertical mode 2 and horizontal modes 1 and 2 were initiated after a wind event, and the tracer moved 950 m into the interior after 29.2 h. Four potential mechanisms for spreading of the tracer from the boundary to the interior were considered: intrusions from boundary mixing, horizontal dispersion, advection by seiches, and advection and dispersion driven by internal waves. Some evidence of boundary mixing was observed 0.5 h before the dye injection, when the speed of seiche-driven currents was large, but a model of an intrusion driven by steady input overpredicted the propagation distance by a factor of about two. A one-dimensional model with only dispersion yielded a dispersion coefficient of 0.8 m2 s−1, and a one-dimensional model with only advection caused by internal waves predicted the position of the peak concentration and a change in longitudinal variance that was 60\% of the measured change. Estimates of dispersion caused by the interaction of vertical diffusion with velocity gradients in the internal wave field are large enough to explain the rest of the spreading and suggest that the transport can be modeled as wave-driven advection and dispersion.},

	abstract = {Internal wave theory is used to examine the generation, radiation, and energy dissipation of internal tides in the deep ocean. Estimates of vertical energy flux based on a previously developed model are adjusted to account for the influence of finite depth, varying stratification, and two-dimensional topography. Specific estimates of energy flux are made for midocean ridge topography. Weakly nonlinear theory is applied to the wave generation at idealized topography to examine finite amplitude corrections to the linear theory. Most internal tide energy is generated at low modes associated with spatial scales from roughly 20 to 100 km. The Richardson number of the radiated internal tide typically exceeds unity for these motions, and so direct shear instability of the generated waves is not the dominant energy transfer mechanism. It also seems that wave–wave interactions are ineffective at transferring energy from the large wavelengths that dominate the energy flux. Instead, it appears that most of the internal tide energy is radiated over O(1000 km) distances. A small fraction of energy flux, less than 30\%, is generated at smaller spatial scales, and this energy flux may dissipate locally. Estimates along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the South Atlantic suggest that the vertical energy flux of M2 internal tides is 3–5 mW m−2, with 1–2 mW m−2 likely contributing to local mixing. Along the East Pacific Rise, bathymetry is more smooth and tides are weaker, and estimates suggest internal tide energy flux is negligible. Radiated low modes are likely influenced by topographic scattering, though general topography scatters less than 10\% of the low-mode energy to higher wavenumbers. Thus, low-mode internal tides may contribute to mixing at locations far away from their generation sites.},

Fractal scaling relationships have been found in distributions of both land surface topography and solute efflux from watersheds, but the linkage between those observations has not been realized. We show that the fractal nature of the land surface in fluvial and glacial systems produces fractal distributions of recharge, discharge, and associated subsurface flow patterns. Interfacial flux tends to be dominated by small-scale features while the flux through deeper subsurface flow paths tends to be controlled by larger-scale features. This scaling behavior holds at all scales, from small fluvial bedforms (tens of centimeters) to the continental landscape (hundreds of kilometers). The fractal nature of surface-subsurface water fluxes yields a single scale-independent distribution of subsurface water residence times for both near-surface fluvial systems and deeper hydrogeological flows.},

It was found that (1) ∼1.9\% of the vertical wind energy flux P10 (∼39 mW m−2), estimated 10 m above the lake surface, was available for turbulent mixing in the entire lake water body; (2) ∼1.5\% of P10 was dissipated by turbulence in the weakly stratified surface layer (epilimnion ;6 m deep), and ∼0.42\% of P10 reached the stratified deep water (hypolimnion) as turbulent kinetic energy via internal seiching; (3) ∼90\% of the turbulent kinetic energy in the stratified water (i.e., 0.38\% of P10 ) was dissipated within the bottom boundary layer of a few meters thickness, whereas only ∼10\% was lost in the interior (away from the boundary; 0.04\% of P10); and (4) as a consequence mixing within the bottom boundary was found to be the main source of vertical mixing for the deep waters of the whole lake. The ratio of buoyancy flux to dissipation (i.e., the mixing efficiency) was found to be ϒmix ∼ 0.15, leading to agreement between the Osborn-Cox microstructure diffusivities and basin-wide tracer diffusivities. Comparison with turbulent kinetic energy balances, performed in five other lakes, demonstrates that this analysis is representative for many enclosed water bodies, as long as wind is the dominant source of turbulent energy (i.e., if other processes, such as convective mixing, double diffusion, or riverine intrusions can be neglected). Although the lakes under consideration were very different in size and shape and although the currents in Lake Baikal were inertial rather than seiching related as in the other lakes, the turbulent kinetic energy balance was very similar and the mixing efficiency was identical. Typically, 0.3 ± 0.1\% of P10 is transferred as turbulent kinetic energy into the stratified part of the water body, and 0.04 ± 0.02\% of P10 is stored as potential energy in the stratification. This analysis provides a tool for estimating vertical diffusivity for wind-driven hypolimnetic mixing within a factor of two based on stratification and wind measurements alone.},

	abstract = {The absorption of light or radiation drives turbulent convection inside stars, supernovae, frozen lakes, and Earth’s mantle. In these contexts, the goal of laboratory and numerical studies is to determine the relation between the internal temperature gradients and the heat flux transported by the turbulent flow. This is the constitutive law of turbulent convection, to be input into large-scale models of such natural flows. However, in contrast with the radiative heating of natural flows, laboratory experiments have focused on convection driven by heating and cooling plates; the heat transport is then severely restricted by boundary layers near the plates, which prevents the realization of the mixing length scaling law used in evolution models of geophysical and astrophysical flows. There is therefore an important discrepancy between the scaling laws measured in laboratory experiments and those used, e.g., in stellar evolution models. Here we provide experimental and numerical evidence that radiatively driven convection spontaneously achieves the mixing length scaling regime, also known as the “ultimate” regime of thermal convection. This constitutes a clear observation of this regime of turbulent convection. Our study therefore bridges the gap between models of natural flows and laboratory experiments. It opens an experimental avenue for a priori determinations of the constitutive laws to be implemented into models of geophysical and astrophysical flows, as opposed to empirical fits of these constitutive laws to the scarce observational data.},

The convection arises from solar heating of water beneath lake ice. Since the water is below its temperature of maximum density, heating due to the absorption of radiation passing through the ice results in a mixed layer which increases in thickness with time. Observations taken with an electronic bathythermograph and by recording thermistor chains have permitted the estimation of that fraction of kinetic energy made available by the gravitational instability, which is converted into potential energy by entrainment of stable fluid as the convecting layer advances. Twelve independent estimates vary from 0.003 to 0.113 with an average value of 0.036. This result qualitatively agrees with the laboratory work of Deardorff, Willis and Lilly (1969) who found that only a small fraction (about 0.015) was recovered in this way. However, relatively little penetration can have a significant effect on mixed layer growth; the results obtained in the present study correspond to a mixed layer thickness 17\% greater than that predicted for zero penetration in the case of a linear initial density profile.},

All one needs is a functional form for the theoretical spectrum and an estimate for the instrumental noise spectrum. The method, based on direct application of the maximum likelihood approach, has several advantages over other fitting techniques. 1) It is unbiased in comparison with other least squares or cost function–based approaches. 2) It is insensitive to dips and wiggles in the spectrum, due to the small number of fitted parameters. It is also robust because the range of wavenumbers used in the fit is held fixed, and the built-in noise model forces the routine to ignore the spectrum as it gets down toward the noise level. 3) The method provides a theoretical estimate for error bars on the fitted Batchelor wavenumber, based on how broad or narrow the likelihood function is in the vicinity of its peak. 4) Statistical quantities that indicate how well the observed spectrum fits the theoretical form are calculated. This is extremely useful in automating analysis software, to get the computer to automatically flag “bad” fits. The method is demonstrated using data from the Self-Contained Autonomous Microstructure Profiler (SCAMP), a free-falling temperature microstructure profiler. Maximum likelihood fits to the Batchelor spectrum are compared to the SCAMP-generated fits and other least squares techniques, and also tested against pseudodata generated by Monte Carlo techniques.

The monotonic instability of the mechanical equilibrium of the fluid with respect to small perturbations periodic along the layer is studied by the linearization method. The Lyapunov-Schmidt method is used to construct the secondary steady convective flows. The applicability of these methods in incompressible fluid stability problems was demonstrated in [8–10]. The calculations show that, starting from a certain value of the parameter , the branching is subcritical for any cell side ratio and a fixed wave vector modulus. For smaller values of the nature of the branching depends on the cell side ratio. This points to subcritical branching and hysteresis effects in those cases in which the periodicity of the perturbations is determined by external factors (corrugation of the boundary, spatially periodic temperature modulation, etc.). It is noted that the rectangular convection amplitude tends to zero when the cell side ratio tends to 3, the value at which hexagonal cellular convection is possible.},

Measurements performed using a thermistor chain and vertical profiling sensors were used to examine temperature dynamics in the convectively mixed and stratified layers of the lake. Radiative transfer through the ice was high leading to a large convective mixed layer (up to 20 m deep) during daytime. Convective velocity was evaluated using two different methods. It is shown that convective velocity (a maximum value of {\textasciitilde}7.4 mm s⁻¹, and daytime average of 3.9 mm s⁻¹) is completely damped during the restratifying night hours. We observed internal waves in the thermocline below the convective mixed layer with intriguing variations between night and day. Maximum of internal wave energy was found to start in the afternoon and continue long after the end of solar radiation forcing. Our analysis indicates that local convective processes are key forcing mechanisms for the generation of internal waves in ice-covered lakes. We also hypothesize that spatial differential heating between the nearshore regions and the centre of the bay (e.g. density current intruding the thermocline) could be a source of internal waves in ice-covered lakes.},

A dense underflow originating near the shore converges toward the lake center, where it produces warm upwelling and return flow across the bulk of lake water column. The return flow, being subject to Coriolis force, creates a lake-wide anticyclonic gyre with velocities of 2–4 cm s-1. While warm underflows are common on ice-covered lakes, the key finding is the basin-scale anticyclonic gyre with warm upwelling in the core. This circulation mechanism provides a key to understanding transport processes in (semi) enclosed basins subject to negative buoyancy flux due to heating (or cooling at temperatures above TMD) at their lateral boundaries.},

	abstract = {Penetrative convection is discussed where the instability is driven by radiative heating of water below the temperature of maximum density. Convection of this type occurs in ice-covered freshwater lakes in late spring, when the snow cover vanishes and solar radiation is absorbed beneath the ice cover. The vertical temperature structure, bulk mixed layer scaling, and mixed layer deepening are examined for a number of temperate and polar lakes. A bulk mixed layer scaling for this type of convection is based on energy arguments underlying the classical Deardorff convective scaling. The depth of the convective layer serves as an appropriate length scale. However, a modified scale that takes account of the energetics of a distributed radiation source term replaces the surface buoyancy flux velocity scale used by Deardorff. The scaling compares favorably with large-eddy simulations of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and with both observations and large-eddy simulations of the TKE dissipation rate. Mixed layer deepening is simulated with a model of convection beneath lake ice. The model describes the structure of the stably stratified layer just beneath the ice with a stationary solution to the heat transfer equation; the structure of the entrainment layer is parameterized with a zero-order jump approach. The entrainment equation is derived from the mixed layer TKE budget and bulk mixed layer scaling. Entrainment regimes characteristic of convection beneath ice are analyzed. It is shown that if the Deardorff convective velocity scale is replaced with a scale incorporating the distributed buoyancy flux, the entrainment equation describing atmospheric and oceanic convective boundary layers also applies beneath the ice. Model predictions compare well with data from observations in a number of lakes. We propose and compare with observations an extension of the mixed layer model that allows for the inclusion of salinity. Although the salt concentration is low in most temperate and polar lakes, its dynamical effect can be significant close to the temperature of maximum density.},

overshoot into stable regions. Strong circulation cells centered in the unstably stratified portion of the layer are accompanied by weaker countercells filling the remainder of the layer.

	abstract = {Convection in an ice-covered lake, driven by the absorption of solar radiation, is investigated by means of temperature microstructure technique. This type of convection typically occurs in spring, when melting snow on the ice cover enables solar radiation to penetrate into the water body. The diurnal dynamics of the stratification system of five distinct layers is analyzed by means of consecutive CTD profiles and with the aid of a one-dimensional model. The model solves the transfer equation of heat and salinity and includes convective procedures to react on density instabilities. This study is focused on the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) balance. The stratification analysis reveals the importance of several processes for the TKE balance, namely: (1) the entrainment into the top layer from the convective layer below, (2) the inflow of water from melted ice, and (3) the volumetric solar heating. Enabled by the analysis of the temperature microstructure profiles, two TKE budgets are presented. The temporally averaged budget reveals a vertical distribution of generation and dissipation rate similar to the case of cooling-induced convection in a surface boundary layer. But contrary to this reference regime, a transition layer was found in the upper convective layer, where both rates drop back to zero toward the layer above. The second TKE budget is spatially averaged over the convective layer but resolves the diurnal dynamics. The generation rate and dissipation rate feature similar diurnal dynamics, where the dissipation lags on average by 1.5 hours. The temporal change rate of TKE was found to be on the same order of magnitude as the generation rate and the dissipation rate, while the export rate of TKE out of the convective layer was found to be less significant.},

The convective mixed layer is defined as the region where the convective Richardson number (Ri) is ≤1. In the absence of a convective mixed layer, peaks in chlorophyll a were near the ice–water interface. Light conditions here seemed sufficient to support phytoplankton biomass accrual in the short-term in 50\% of our measurements, although snow depths {\textgreater}13.5 cm may lead to light limitation. When a convective mixed layer was present, light conditions were sufficient for biomass accrual in 37.5\% of cases. The frictional timescale for damping averaged 15 minutes, indicative of a lack of mixing at night. Convective mixing depths and velocity increased as snow declined, and results demonstrated the potential for rapid convective mixed layer deepening (up to 6.6 m h−1), underscoring the highly dynamic physical environment under ice. Although declining periods of ice cover have been subject to much attention, changes in snow cover may have equally important implications for primary producers and the potential for under-ice blooms.

Humidity was used as an indicator of thermals. The variables were first high-pass filtered with a 5 km cutoff digital filter to eliminate mesoscale variations. Segments of the 5 min (30 km length) horizontal flight legs with humidity greater than half the standard deviation of humidity fluctuations for that leg were defined as thermals. This was found to be a better indicator of thermals than temperature in the upper part of the boundary layer since the temperature in a thermal is cooler than its environment in the upper part of the boundary layer. Using mixed-layer scaling, the normalized length and number of thermals were found to scale with the 1/3 and -1/3 powers, respectively, of normalized height, while vertical velocity and temperature scaled according to similarity predictions in the free convection region of the surface layer. The observational results presented here extend throughout the entire mixed layer. Using these results in the equation for mean updraft velocity of a field of thermals, the sum of the vertical pressure gradient and edge-effect terms can be estimated. This residual term is found to be important throughout most of the boundary layer. The magnitude of the divergence of vertical velocity variance within a thermal is found to be larger than the magnitude of the mean updraft velocity term throughout most of the mixed layer.},

	abstract = {Results from a boundary layer experiment conducted over a flat site in northwestern Minnesota are discussed. Wind and temperature fluctuations near the ground were measured with AFCRL's fast-response instrumentation on a 32 m tower. Measurements between 32 m and the inversion base zi were made with MRU probes attached at five different heights to the tethering cable of a 1300 m2 kite balloon. The daytime convective boundary layer appears to be well-mixed with evidence of significant heat and momentum entrainment through the capping inversion. The spectra of velocity components are generalized within the framework of mixed-layer similarity. The characteristic wavelength for w increases linearly with height up to z = 0.l zi following free convection prediction, but approaches a limiting value of 1.5 zi, in the upper half of the boundary layer. The characteristic wavelengths for u and v are maintained at approximately 1.5 zi down to heights very close to the ground. This limiting wavelength corresponds to the length scale of large convective elements which extend to the top of the boundary layer. The behavior of the temperature specra above 0.l zi cannot be generalized in the same manner. Below that height the θ spectra follow behavior observed in the surface layer; z = 0.1 zi is also the upper limit for the free convection predictions of the w and θ variances. The high-order moments and the structure parameters reveal the strong influence of entrainment at heights above 0.5 zi.},

	abstract = {This paper is a study of turbulence near rigid surfaces, in the absence of any mean shear. Different sources of turbulence are considered, including thermal convection and grid turbulence. It is shown that, if a rigid boundary is introduced into the flow, then for short times the linear theory of Hunt \& Graham (1978) reveals the common structure of these flows near the boundary, if the parameters used are the rate of energy dissipation per unit mass ε and the distance z from the surface. Over longer times nonlinear effects develop, such as large eddies straining smaller eddies near the boundary. Some new estimates are suggested here and compared with the computations of Biringen \& Reynolds (1981) and experiments of Thomas \& Hancock (1977).It is shown that calculations based on the linear theory agree well with many measurements of the vertical profiles of turbulence in thermal convection layers, including those of the vertical variance, the low-frequency end of the spectrum of the vertical turbulence (w), the integral scale of w, and two-point cross-correlations of w. (The latter was a prediction, subsequently tested by atmospheric measurements.) Some discussion of the reasons for this agreement are suggested. The observations of the effects of mean-velocity gradients near the surface are also shown to be consistent with the theoretical arguments proposed here.},

	abstract = {An infinite fluid with a vertical cubic temperature profile in the absence of fluid motion is considered as a model for penetrative convection in which a central unstably stratified fluid layer is bounded above and below by stably stratified layers. Turbulence statistics from direct and large eddy numerical simulations for the mean temperature gradient, the velocity and temperature variances and the heat flux are presented for Rayleigh numbers R up to four orders of magnitude above critical. By means of a simplified second-moment closure, analytical scaling laws for the statistics are determined. For high Rayleigh numbers, the mean temperature gradient approaches zero in a central well-mixed layer, a reduced positive (stable) value in upper and lower partially mixed layers, and an unmixed value far above and below. The temperature variance is a factor of R1/3 larger in the partially mixed layers compared to the well-mixed layer; the velocity variance and heat flux scales the same in both layers. Approximation of the three layers by a two layer model yields an estimate for the height of the mixed layer: the height decreases slowly with increasing Rayleigh number and at the highest Rayleigh number simulated is approximately 30\% longer than the unstable layer in the absence of fluid motion.},

	abstract = {Hutchinson and Löffler's (1956) classification of lakes based on the seasonal thermal mixing regime has become a cornerstone of any analysis of lakes as elements of the earth surface. Until now however the lake classification has lacked a physically sound quantitative criterion distinguishing between two fundamental lake types: thermally stratified during a large portion of the year (mono- and dimictic) and predominantly mixed to the bottom (polymictic). Using the mechanistic balance between potential and kinetic energy we review the different formulations of the Richardson number to derive a generalized scaling for seasonal stratification in a closed lake basin. The scaling parameter is the critical mean basin depth, Hcrit, that delineates lakes that mix regularly from those that stratify seasonally based on lake water transparency, lake length, and an annual mean estimate for the Monin-Obukhov length. We validate the scaling on available data of lakes worldwide using logistic regression. The scaling criterion consistently described the mixing regime significantly better than either the conventional unbounded basin scaling or a simple depth threshold. Thus, the generalized scaling is universal for freshwater lakes and allows the seasonal mixing regime to be estimated without numerically solving the heat transport equations.},

We consider different modeling strategies and new tools that have been developed. Simulation results, the wealth of observational material collected during large-scale experiments, and new laboratory data reveal how the cascade of energy from tidal flow to turbulence occurs through a host of nonlinear processes, including intensified boundary flows, wave breaking, wave-wave interactions, and the instability of high-mode internal wave beams. The roles of various nondimensional parameters involving the ocean state, roughness geometry, and tidal forcing are described.},

frequency N(z). Approximate solution are computed using the WKB method, which reduce to the previous result for an ocean of infinite depth with constant stratification. The conversion rate for a finite-depth ocean can be substantially smaller than the infinite-ocean prediction when the length scale of the topography is of the same order as the horizontal wave length of the internal tide. The conversion rate for
two-dimensional Gaussian seamounts is calculated. Using observed
statistics for the distribution of seamounts, we estimate 1/4 GW of conversion for a square of ocean floor of side 1000 km.},
